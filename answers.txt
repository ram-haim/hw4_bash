1. We can see that there are lots of links for articles thus we can surely believe that searching manually each link for the chosen words
 will take a long time, approximately 2 hours or so.
2. We came to the conclusions that this method is efficient when we would like to perform some operations such as searching or changing data 
in a large database like a big program or project containing a lot of different files.
3. In case we would want to repeat the action we can use the 'Watch' command with an interval of an hour.
We can simply write a simple script with the command that will run automatically our script every hour.
After running the script again we can use the 'uniq' command in order not to count articles in which we have already checked.
